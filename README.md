# Advanced-NLP - Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing - Exercises

Hello!

You are probably here seeking understanding in the realm of Deep Learning applied to Natural Language Processing. It's my hope that this repository can assist you. For detailed guidelines on executing these exercises, refer to the original [course webpage](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/).

Here are some of the results obtained from the third assignment:

**One-Layer RNN:**

* wvecDim = 5 : 0.740343088764;
* wvecDim = 15: 0.766135064058;
* wvecDim = 25: 0.793929596835;
* wvecDim = 30: 0.796149299105;
* wvecDim = 35: 0.801746809178;
* wvecDim = 45: 0.801505537192;

**Two-Layer RNN (deep RNN2):**

* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 5 : 0.733490964364;
