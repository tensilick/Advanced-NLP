    "To appreciate the power of neural networks to learn complex patterns, it can help to revisit a classic example. It is well-known that a single linear classifier cannot represent the XOR function $x \\oplus y$, depicted below*: there is no way to draw a single line that can separate the red and magenta (square) points from the blue and cyan (circle) points.\n",

    "*Gaussian noise is added to make the point clouds more illustrative; however, you can perform your analysis as if all points were truly boolean variables $(x,y) \\in \\{0,1\\}^2$."
